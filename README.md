Coded for fun and for learning :-) 

Classic Batle ship game. The goal is to sink all the ships.
There are one 4 mast ship, two 3 mast ships, three 2 mast ships
and four 1 mast ships.
At the begining the player has 5 tries. For every hit the player
gets +1 try. For every miss the player looses one try.

Have fun.
